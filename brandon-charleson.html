      <!-- About Section -->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>What We Know About You</h2>
        <p>You're a builder at the intersection of military precision and modern GTM automation. As Founder of Top of Funnel, Clay Certified Expert, and Instantly.ai consultant, you bring systematic thinking from 13 years of Air Force service to solving GTM challenges through integration ecosystems.</p>

        <p>Your background spans from digital filmmaking at LA Film School to exercise science at American Military University, but it's your operational excellence mindset—honed through military service from 2003-2016—that defines your approach to GTM systems. You're not just implementing tools; you're architecting integration layers that make GTM operations systematic and scalable.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Why This Conversation Section -->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Why This Conversation Matters</h2>

        <h3>Unique Perspective</h3>
        <p>You treat GTM operations like software development—using GitHub repos, branches, and PRs for client GTM codebases. You built an MCP server for a legacy SaaS client in one afternoon, transforming them from "we don't have an API" to having an AI-powered interface. You predicted 2026 will be defined by integration ecosystems before most operators realized tactical tool connections wouldn't scale. Your willingness to experiment (TOON format, AI model selection, immediate n8n node builds) reveals someone who tests rather than waits for best practices.</p>

        <h3>GTM Relevance</h3>
        <p>Your "GTM as development project" approach challenges how most operators think about revenue work—showing what becomes possible when you apply software engineering practices to GTM operations. Your speed of execution (modernizing legacy systems in hours, not months) and architectural thinking (integration ecosystems vs. point solutions) map directly to what our audience is building: scalable, systematic GTM infrastructure.</p>

        <h3>Audience Value</h3>
        <p>Listeners will learn how to shift from spreadsheet-based GTM work to version-controlled development projects, how to modernize legacy systems without full rebuilds using MCP, what drives experimentation decisions versus sticking with proven approaches, and how to identify when companies are thinking architecturally versus just connecting tools. Your work shows the practical path from "GTM as ops" to "GTM as engineering."</p>

      <!-- From Their Content Section -->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>From Your Content</h2>
        <p>We've been following your work closely. Here are some insights that particularly resonated:</p>

        <div class="topic-card">
          <div class="topic-title">Token Efficiency as Constraint-Driven Design</div>
          <p>Your TOON format experimentation (Token-Oriented Object Notion) reveals how constraints force clarity in system design. You've implemented this into Instantly.ai's MCP Server and measured real token savings—showing that less structure can produce better outputs when designed intentionally.</p>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>"TOON format aims to simplify the data structure by being more token efficient when using AI applications (especially when context windows are a current challenge). I've tested this and already implemented it into the upcoming Instantly.ai's MCP Server, and already showing improvements in how the responses are handled, thus saving tokens."</p>

        <div class="topic-card">
          <div class="topic-title">2026 Prediction: Integration Ecosystems Over Point Solutions</div>
          <p>Your prediction that 2026 will be defined by integration ecosystems—not individual tools—reveals architectural thinking about GTM infrastructure. You're seeing the shift from "connecting tools" to "building systematic connection layers" before most operators realize it's happening.</p>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>"There has never been a better time than now to be a 'Builder'... I am a firm believer that 2026 is the year in which more SaaS and web apps are becoming more and more integrated with each other, and nearly all will have their own Chatbot or integrate with an existing Chatbot. Whether that is baked in or via protocols like MCP (or 'Connectors')—integrations and partnerships are never more important than now to stay relevant."</p>

          <div class="topic-title">Treating GTM as a Development Project—Git Workflows for Revenue Operations</div>
          <p>You evolved your GTM motion from "full-send" to "full-dev PLUS full-send"—treating client GTM operations like software projects with GitHub repos, branches, and PRs. Your approach reveals a completely different mental model for how GTM work should be structured.</p>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>"Any GTM motion is truly no different than any development project. You're taking data, running code through it, and molding it in a way that can be utilized to create value... You're literally limited by your imagination and your environment/platform."</p>

      <!-- Discussion Topics Section -->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Discussion Framework</h2>
        <p>We've identified several areas where your experience could provide unique value to GTM operators:</p>

        <div class="topic-card">
          <div class="topic-title">Topic 1: Experimentation Mindset—What Drives You to Test New Approaches</div>
          <p><strong>Why this is interesting:</strong> You're constantly experimenting—TOON format for token efficiency, open-source AI models when closed-source won't work, new integration patterns. Most operators stick with proven approaches. Your willingness to test reveals a different relationship with risk and learning.</p>

          <h3>Questions we're excited to explore:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You're constantly experimenting—TOON format, AI models, n8n nodes. What drives your decision to experiment with something versus stick with what works? When do you know something is worth the time to test?</li>
            <li>Have any of these experiments surprised you—gone differently than you expected? What did that teach you about how you approach new tools or methods?</li>
            <li>Most GTM operators wait for best practices to emerge before adopting new approaches. What's an unpopular opinion you have about how teams should think about experimentation?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="topic-card">
          <div class="topic-title">Topic 2: Integration Ecosystems—Predicting 2026 Before Others See It</div>
          <p><strong>Why this is interesting:</strong> You predicted 2026 will be about integration ecosystems, not individual tools. Most teams are still thinking tactically about tool selection. This prediction reveals you're seeing architectural patterns emerge that others are missing.</p>

          <h3>Questions we're excited to explore:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You predicted 2026 will be about integration ecosystems—systematic connection layers, not just better point solutions. What made you see this before others? What are you noticing that most operators aren't?</li>
            <li>What are you building NOW because of this prediction that most operators aren't? How does seeing this shift change what you prioritize in your work?</li>
            <li>When you look at a company's tech stack, what tells you they're thinking architecturally versus just connecting tools? What's the difference in how their systems perform?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="topic-card">
          <div class="topic-title">Topic 3: Building for Legacy SaaS—MCP as the Modernization Layer</div>
          <p><strong>Why this is interesting:</strong> You built an MCP server for a legacy SaaS client in one afternoon—transforming them from "we don't have an API" to "we have an AI-powered data interface." Most consultants would recommend a full rebuild. Your approach reveals how you think about modernization: build connection layers, don't rewrite everything.</p>

          <h3>Questions we're excited to explore:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You built an MCP server for a legacy SaaS client connecting Claude to their Snowflake data—transformed them from "we don't have an API" to having an AI-powered interface. Walk me through why you chose that approach. What were they struggling with before, and what made MCP the right solution?</li>
            <li>You said "If your SaaS doesn't have a strategy for AI integration and MCP, you're not just behind—you're becoming irrelevant." That's a strong statement. What are you seeing that makes you so certain about this? What happens to companies that wait?</li>
            <li>When you're working with a legacy company that doesn't have modern APIs, how do you help them think about where to start? What's the first thing you build to prove the concept is worth pursuing?</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="topic-title">Topic 4: Treating GTM as a Development Project—Git Workflows for Revenue Operations</div>
          <p><strong>Why this is interesting:</strong> You evolved your GTM motion from "full-send" to "full-dev PLUS full-send"—treating client GTM operations like software projects with GitHub repos, branches, and PRs. Most operators still use Google Drive and spreadsheets. Your approach reveals a completely different mental model for how GTM work should be structured.</p>

          <h3>Questions we're excited to explore:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You said "any GTM motion is truly no different than any development project—you're taking data, running code through it, and molding it in a way that can be utilized to create value." When did you realize GTM work should be treated like software development? What changed in how you work?</li>
            <li>Most GTM teams still use spreadsheets and Google Drive for collaboration. When you shifted to treating GTM as a development project, what was the first thing that got better? What changes when you think of revenue operations as code instead of just ops work?</li>
            <li>You mentioned downloading entire CRM datasets to show clients "how messy their data actually is." What's the most common thing companies don't realize about their own data until they see it this way? What usually surprises them?</li>

        <h2>Conversation Starters</h2>
        <p>Here are all the questions we're excited to explore with you:</p>

        <h3>Opening Questions (we'll use 1-2 as needed to orient the audience)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>You went from 13 years in the Air Force to founding Top of Funnel, working across Clay, Instantly.ai, and building n8n community nodes. Walk me through how you got into thinking about GTM as integration architecture rather than just tool implementation.</li>
          <li>What does Top of Funnel actually do day-to-day? You describe yourself as a builder—what does that mean in practice when you're working with GTM teams?</li>
          <li>How is your approach to GTM different because of your military background? Where did you realize that operational discipline from the Air Force applied to revenue operations?</li>
          <li>You're predicting 2026 will be about "the rise of the integration ecosystem." How has your thinking about GTM infrastructure evolved from when you started to now?</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Topic 1: Experimentation Mindset</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>You're constantly experimenting—TOON format, AI models, n8n nodes. What drives your decision to experiment with something versus stick with what works? When do you know something is worth the time to test?</li>
          <li>Have any of these experiments surprised you—gone differently than you expected? What did that teach you about how you approach new tools or methods?</li>
          <li>Most GTM operators wait for best practices to emerge before adopting new approaches. What's an unpopular opinion you have about how teams should think about experimentation?</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Topic 2: Integration Ecosystems</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>You predicted 2026 will be about integration ecosystems—systematic connection layers, not just better point solutions. What made you see this before others? What are you noticing that most operators aren't?</li>
          <li>What are you building NOW because of this prediction that most operators aren't? How does seeing this shift change what you prioritize in your work?</li>
          <li>When you look at a company's tech stack, what tells you they're thinking architecturally versus just connecting tools? What's the difference in how their systems perform?</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Topic 3: Building for Legacy SaaS</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>You built an MCP server for a legacy SaaS client connecting Claude to their Snowflake data—transformed them from "we don't have an API" to having an AI-powered interface. Walk me through why you chose that approach. What were they struggling with before, and what made MCP the right solution?</li>
          <li>You said "If your SaaS doesn't have a strategy for AI integration and MCP, you're not just behind—you're becoming irrelevant." That's a strong statement. What are you seeing that makes you so certain about this? What happens to companies that wait?</li>
          <li>When you're working with a legacy company that doesn't have modern APIs, how do you help them think about where to start? What's the first thing you build to prove the concept is worth pursuing?</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Topic 4: Treating GTM as a Development Project</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>You said "any GTM motion is truly no different than any development project—you're taking data, running code through it, and molding it in a way that can be utilized to create value." When did you realize GTM work should be treated like software development? What changed in how you work?</li>
          <li>Most GTM teams still use spreadsheets and Google Drive for collaboration. When you shifted to treating GTM as a development project, what was the first thing that got better? What changes when you think of revenue operations as code instead of just ops work?</li>
          <li>You mentioned downloading entire CRM datasets to show clients "how messy their data actually is." What's the most common thing companies don't realize about their own data until they see it this way? What usually surprises them?</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Closing Question</h3>
        <div class="question">
          <p>What is one thing that most people in GTM believe to be true, but your experience tells you otherwise?</p>
