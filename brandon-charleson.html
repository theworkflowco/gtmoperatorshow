        <h2>What We Know About You</h2>
        <p>You're a builder at the intersection of military precision and modern GTM automation. As Founder of Top of Funnel, Clay Certified Expert, and Instantly.ai consultant, you bring systematic thinking from 13 years of Air Force service to solving GTM challenges through integration ecosystems.</p>

        <p>Your background spans from digital filmmaking at LA Film School to exercise science at American Military University, but it's your operational excellence mindset—honed through military service from 2003-2016—that defines your approach to GTM systems. You're not just implementing tools; you're architecting integration layers that make GTM operations systematic and scalable.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Why This Conversation Section -->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Why This Conversation Matters</h2>
        <p>You represent a rare intersection: military operational discipline meets modern GTM tooling expertise. Your work on token efficiency, integration ecosystems, and systematic automation reveals someone thinking deeply about how GTM systems should actually work—not just what features exist.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <p>The GTM Operator Show audience needs to hear from operators who are building with first-principles thinking. Your approach to Clay implementations, n8n community contributions, and TOON format experimentation demonstrates someone solving real problems through systematic engineering—not just following best practices.</p>

      <!-- From Their Content Section -->

        <h2>From Your Content</h2>
        <p>We've been following your work closely. Here are some insights that particularly resonated:</p>

        <div class="topic-card">
          <div class="topic-title">Token Efficiency as Constraint-Driven Design</div>
          <p>Your TOON format experimentation (Token-Oriented Object Notion) reveals how constraints force clarity in system design. You've implemented this into Instantly.ai's MCP Server and measured real token savings—showing that less structure can produce better outputs when designed intentionally.</p>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>"TOON format aims to simplify the data structure by being more token efficient when using AI applications (especially when context windows are a current challenge). I've tested this and already implemented it into the upcoming Instantly.ai's MCP Server, and already showing improvements in how the responses are handled, thus saving tokens."</p>

          <div class="topic-title">2026 Prediction: Integration Ecosystems Over Point Solutions</div>
          <p>Your prediction that 2026 will be defined by integration ecosystems—not individual tools—reveals architectural thinking about GTM infrastructure. You're seeing the shift from "connecting tools" to "building systematic connection layers" before most operators realize it's happening.</p>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>"There has never been a better time than now to be a 'Builder'... I am a firm believer that 2026 is the year in which more SaaS and web apps are becoming more and more integrated with each other, and nearly all will have their own Chatbot or integrate with an existing Chatbot. Whether that is baked in or via protocols like MCP (or 'Connectors')—integrations and partnerships are never more important than now to stay relevant."</p>

          <div class="topic-title">Building What Doesn't Exist (n8n Community Nodes)</div>
          <p>You've built multiple n8n community nodes "in your sleep" because you refuse to let integration gaps block workflows. This builder mindset—creating connectors when they don't exist rather than accepting limitations—separates operators who configure from operators who engineer.</p>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>"Since I've built several n8n community nodes that I can basically do them in my sleep, I thought it'd be great to just kick this off and have it available IMMEDIATELY for n8n community users to be able to leverage this great tool... For n8n cloud users, it'll come! Just need to send to the team for verification."</p>

          <div class="topic-title">Military Operational Excellence Applied to GTM</div>
          <p>Your Veterans Day reflection revealed how military values—service first, humility, show up, stay ready, ultimate sacrifice—shaped your approach to GTM systems. These aren't abstract principles; they're operational frameworks you apply to building systematic, mission-critical GTM infrastructure.</p>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>"Military service wasn't just something we did—it was woven into the fabric of who we are as a family. Service first - It's never about you. It's about the mission and the people around you. The mission MUST get done. Humility - No matter your rank or role, you stay grounded. Show up - There's no 'calling in sick.' You show up when it matters most. These aren't just military values. They're life values."</p>

      <!-- Discussion Topics Section -->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Discussion Framework</h2>
        <p>We've identified several areas where your experience could provide unique value to GTM operators:</p>

        <div class="topic-card">
          <div class="topic-title">Topic 1: From Military Operations to GTM Integration Architecture</div>
          <p><strong>Why this is interesting:</strong> You bring 13 years of Air Force operational discipline to GTM automation. Most operators don't have military systems thinking—understanding how you translate mission-critical frameworks into integration ecosystems could reveal patterns GTM teams are missing when they treat their GTM stack as a collection of tools rather than a systematic operation.</p>

          <h3>Questions we're excited to explore:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You've written about how military values—"service first, show up, stay ready, the mission MUST get done"—aren't just military values, they're life values. What ties these operational frameworks together in your mind when you're designing integration layers for a GTM system? What did you have to learn the hard way about applying military discipline to revenue operations?</li>
            <li>Walk me through how you think about GTM infrastructure differently because of your Air Force background. When you look at how most companies build their GTM stack, what patterns would never survive in military operations?</li>
            <li>Tell me about a time when you saw a GTM team's system fail in a way that reminded you of operational failures in the military. What was the root cause, and how did you rebuild it with mission-critical thinking?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="topic-card">
          <div class="topic-title">Topic 2: Integration Ecosystems vs Point Solutions</div>
          <p><strong>Why this is interesting:</strong> You've predicted 2026 will be about "the rise of the integration ecosystem"—systematic connection layers that make point solutions actually scale. Most teams are still connecting tools without thinking architecturally. This shift from tactical tool adoption to strategic infrastructure is something GTM operators need to understand before they're forced to rebuild everything.</p>

          <h3>Questions we're excited to explore:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You wrote that "integrations and partnerships are never more important than now to stay relevant" and that every SaaS will need to integrate via MCP or Connectors. Walk me through what changed in your thinking—when did you realize this wasn't about picking better tools, but about building the connection layer between them?</li>
            <li>How do you approach designing integration architecture for a GTM motion? When you're starting with a company that has Clay, Instantly, n8n, and their CRM, what's your process for thinking about the integration layer versus just connecting endpoints?</li>
            <li>Tell me about a company where you've seen the shift from "we connect our tools" to "we have an integration ecosystem." What was the inflection point? What had to break first before they understood the difference?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="topic-card">
          <div class="topic-title">Topic 3: Token Efficiency and Constraint-Driven AI Design</div>
          <p><strong>Why this is interesting:</strong> Your TOON format experiments show that constraining tokens actually improves output quality. You've implemented this in Instantly.ai's MCP Server and measured real savings. This counter-intuitive finding—that less structure can produce better outputs when designed intentionally—challenges how most GTM operators think about AI system design.</p>

          <h3>Questions we're excited to explore:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You're testing TOON format (Token-Oriented Object Notion) because context windows are a challenge and you've already seen "improvements in how responses are handled, thus saving tokens." Walk me through what you learned when you first constrained the structure—what surprised you about how the AI responded when you gave it less?</li>
            <li>Most teams approach AI prompts by adding more context, more examples, more instructions. Your work suggests the opposite—that constraint forces clarity. What does this tell you about how GTM operators should be designing AI-native workflows? Where do most teams over-engineer?</li>
            <li>Tell me about a specific implementation where you saw token efficiency translate into better results. Not just cheaper—actually better outputs. What was the use case, and what did the constraint reveal about the system's understanding?</li>

          <div class="topic-title">Topic 4: Builder Mindset—Creating What Doesn't Exist</div>
          <p><strong>Why this is interesting:</strong> You've built multiple n8n community nodes "in your sleep" because integration gaps are where GTM operations break down. When the connectors don't exist, you build them rather than accepting limitations. This "build vs buy vs accept" decision framework is critical for GTM operators who need to know when to extend their tools versus work within constraints.</p>

          <h3>Questions we're excited to explore:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You wrote that you've "built several n8n community nodes that I can basically do them in my sleep" because you needed integrations that didn't exist. Walk me through your decision framework—how do you know when to build versus when to work around the limitation? What signals tell you "this gap is worth solving"?</li>
            <li>How has your thinking about "builder mindset" evolved as you've scaled Top of Funnel? When you started, what kinds of integrations did you build that you'd now tell someone to just work around? What changed?</li>
            <li>Tell me about a time when you built a connector that ended up being critical to a client's GTM motion. What would have broken if you'd accepted the limitation? How did building it change what was possible for their revenue operations?</li>

        <h2>Conversation Starters</h2>
        <p>Here are all the questions we're excited to explore with you:</p>

        <h3>Opening Questions (we'll use 1-2 as needed to orient the audience)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>You went from 13 years in the Air Force to founding Top of Funnel, working across Clay, Instantly.ai, and building n8n community nodes. Walk me through how you got into thinking about GTM as integration architecture rather than just tool implementation.</li>
          <li>What does Top of Funnel actually do day-to-day? You describe yourself as a builder—what does that mean in practice when you're working with GTM teams?</li>
          <li>How is your approach to GTM different because of your military background? Where did you realize that operational discipline from the Air Force applied to revenue operations?</li>
          <li>You're predicting 2026 will be about "the rise of the integration ecosystem." How has your thinking about GTM infrastructure evolved from when you started to now?</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Topic 1: Military Operations to GTM Architecture</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>You've written about how military values—"service first, show up, stay ready, the mission MUST get done"—aren't just military values, they're life values. What ties these operational frameworks together in your mind when you're designing integration layers for a GTM system? What did you have to learn the hard way about applying military discipline to revenue operations?</li>
          <li>Walk me through how you think about GTM infrastructure differently because of your Air Force background. When you look at how most companies build their GTM stack, what patterns would never survive in military operations?</li>
          <li>Tell me about a time when you saw a GTM team's system fail in a way that reminded you of operational failures in the military. What was the root cause, and how did you rebuild it with mission-critical thinking?</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Topic 2: Integration Ecosystems</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>You wrote that "integrations and partnerships are never more important than now to stay relevant" and that every SaaS will need to integrate via MCP or Connectors. Walk me through what changed in your thinking—when did you realize this wasn't about picking better tools, but about building the connection layer between them?</li>
          <li>How do you approach designing integration architecture for a GTM motion? When you're starting with a company that has Clay, Instantly, n8n, and their CRM, what's your process for thinking about the integration layer versus just connecting endpoints?</li>
          <li>Tell me about a company where you've seen the shift from "we connect our tools" to "we have an integration ecosystem." What was the inflection point? What had to break first before they understood the difference?</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Topic 3: Token Efficiency and Constraint-Driven Design</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>You're testing TOON format (Token-Oriented Object Notion) because context windows are a challenge and you've already seen "improvements in how responses are handled, thus saving tokens." Walk me through what you learned when you first constrained the structure—what surprised you about how the AI responded when you gave it less?</li>
          <li>Most teams approach AI prompts by adding more context, more examples, more instructions. Your work suggests the opposite—that constraint forces clarity. What does this tell you about how GTM operators should be designing AI-native workflows? Where do most teams over-engineer?</li>
          <li>Tell me about a specific implementation where you saw token efficiency translate into better results. Not just cheaper—actually better outputs. What was the use case, and what did the constraint reveal about the system's understanding?</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Topic 4: Builder Mindset</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>You wrote that you've "built several n8n community nodes that I can basically do them in my sleep" because you needed integrations that didn't exist. Walk me through your decision framework—how do you know when to build versus when to work around the limitation? What signals tell you "this gap is worth solving"?</li>
          <li>How has your thinking about "builder mindset" evolved as you've scaled Top of Funnel? When you started, what kinds of integrations did you build that you'd now tell someone to just work around? What changed?</li>
          <li>Tell me about a time when you built a connector that ended up being critical to a client's GTM motion. What would have broken if you'd accepted the limitation? How did building it change what was possible for their revenue operations?</li>
        </ol>
